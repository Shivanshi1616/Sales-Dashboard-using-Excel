## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to provide actionable insights for enhancing business strategies. This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the sales performance across various categories, customer segments, and geographic locations, aiding in strategic decision-making for the sales team.

Throughout this project, I've had the chance to:
